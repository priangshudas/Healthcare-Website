        <h2><u> What is Coronavirus (COVID-19)?</u></h2>
    </div>
    
        <img src="/media/covid19.2.jpg" class="img-box">
    <div class="text-box">
    <P>Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that can cause respiratory illness in humans. They are called “corona” because of crown-like spikes on the surface of the virus. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and the common cold are examples of coronaviruses that cause illness in humans.
    
        The new strain of coronavirus — SARS-CoV-2 — was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019. It has since spread to every country around the world.</P>
    <div class="text-box2">
        <h2><u>Where do coronaviruses come from?</u></h2>
        <p> Coronaviruses are often found in bats, cats and camels. The viruses live in but don’t infect the animals. Sometimes these viruses then spread to different animal species. The viruses may change (mutate) as they transfer to other species. Eventually, the virus can jump from animal species and begin to infect humans. In the case of SARS-CoV-19, the first people infected are thought to have contracted the virus at a food market that sold meat, fish and live animals </p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-box3">
        <h2><u>How do you get COVID-19?</u></h2>
        <p>SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, enters your body through your mouth, nose or eyes (directly from the airborne droplets or from the transfer of the virus from your hands to your face). It then travels to the back of your nasal passages and mucous membrane in the back of your throat. It attaches to cells there, begins to multiply and moves into lung tissue. From there, the virus can spread to other body tissues.
       </p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-box4">
        <h2><u>How does the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) spread from person to person?
        </u></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The virus travels in respiratory droplets released into the air when an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks, sings or breathes near you. You may be infected if you inhale these droplets.
            </li>
            <li >You can also get coronavirus from close contact (touching, shaking hands) with an infected person and then touching your face.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="text-box5">
        <h2><u>How long is a person with COVID-19 considered contagious?</u></h2>
        <p>If you have COVID-19 it can take several days to develop symptoms — but you’re contagious during this time. You are no longer contagious 10 days after your symptoms began.</p>
        <p><u>The best way to avoid spreading COVID-19 to others is to:</u></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Stay 6 feet away from others whenever possible.</li>
            <li>
                Wear a cloth mask that covers your mouth and nose when around others.</li>
            <li>Wash your hands often. If soap isn’t available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.</li>
            <li>Avoid crowded indoor spaces. Open windows to bring in outdoor air as much as possible.
            </li>
            <li>Stay self-isolated at home if you are feeling ill with symptoms that could be COVID-19 or have a positive test for COVID-19.
            </li>
            <li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces.
            </li>
             </ul>
            </div>
    <div class="text-box6">
        <h2><u>How soon after becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 will I develop COVID-19 symptoms?</u></h2>
        <p>The time between becoming infected and showing symptoms (incubation period) can range from two to 14 days. The average time before experiencing symptoms is five days. Symptoms can range in severity from very mild to severe. In about 80% of people, COVID-19 causes only mild symptoms, although this may change as variants emerge.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-box7">
        <h2><u>If I recover from a case of COVID-19, can I be infected again?</u></h2>
        <p>If you test positive for SARS-CoV-2 three months after your last positive test, it’s considered a reinfection. Before the omicron variant, reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 was rare but possible.</p>
        <p>Omicron (B.1.1.529) was first reported in South Africa in November 2021 and quickly spread around the world. With many mutations, omicron was able to evade immune systems and we had more reinfections than ever before.</p>
        <p> As the virus that causes COVID-19 continues to mutate, reinfection remains possible. Vaccination — including a booster dose — is the best protection against severe disease.</p>

    <div>
        <h1><i class="fa-solid fa-head-side-mask"></i>Symptoms & Causes:</h1>
        <h2><u>What are the symptoms of COVID-19?</u></h2>
        <p>COVID-19 symptoms vary from person to person. In fact, some infected people don’t develop any symptoms (asymptomatic). In general, people with COVID-19 report some of the following symptoms:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Fever or chills.</li>
        <li>Cough.</li>
        <li>Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.</li>
        <li>Tiredness.</li>
        <li>Muscle or body aches.</li>
        <li>Headaches.</li>
        <li>New loss of taste or smell.</li>
        <li>Sore throat.</li>
        <li>Congestion or runny nose.</li>
        <li>Nausea or vomiting</li>
        <li>Diarrhea.</li>
        </ul>  
        <p><u>Additional symptoms are possible.</u></p>
        <p>Symptoms may appear two to 14 days after exposure to the virus. Children have similar, but usually milder, symptoms than adults. Older adults and people who have severe underlying medical conditions are at higher risk of more serious complication from COVID-19.</p>
        <b><i class="fa-sharp fa-regular fa-phone"></i>Call 911 and get immediate medical attention if you have these warning signs:</b>
    </div>
        <div class="ul"><ul>
            <li>Trouble breathing.</li>
            <li>Persistent pain or pressure in your chest.</li>
            <li>New confusion.</li>
            <li>Inability to wake up from sleep. </li>
            <li>Bluish lips or face.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>This list does not include all possible symptoms. Contact your healthcare provider if you’re concerned you may have coronavirus or have any severe symptoms.</p>
       </div>
       <div class="text-box8">
        <h1 ><i class="fa-solid fa-square-plus"></i>TREATMENT:</h1>
        <h2 class="treatment"><u>What treatments do people receive if they have COVID-19? </u></h2>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Depending on the severity of your COVID symptoms, you may need: </p>
    </div>
    
        <div class="un-order"><ul>
            <li>Supplemental oxygen (given through tubing inserted into your nostrils).
            </li>
            <li>Some people may benefit from an infusion of monoclonal antibodies.
            </li>
            <li>Antiviral medications may reduce the risk of hospitalization and death in certain patients with COVID-19.
            </li>
            <li>Mechanical ventilation (oxygen through a tube inserted down your trachea). You are given medications to keep you comfortable and sleepy as long as you’re receiving oxygen through a ventilator.
            </li>
            <li>Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). You continue to receive treatment while a machine pumps your blood outside your body. It takes over the function of your body’s lungs and heart.
            </li>
          </ul>
       </div>
       <div class="text-box9">
        <h2><u>Can vaccinated people still get COVID-19?</u>
        </h2>
        <p>Yes, it’s possible to get COVID-19 even if you’ve been vaccinated. No vaccines are 100% effective. In fact, breakthrough cases (when someone tests positive more than two weeks after they're fully vaccinated) are expected, especially as the SARS-CoV-2 virus mutates.</p>
        <p>The vaccines significantly reduce — but don’t eliminate — your risk of infection. The risk of a severe illness or death from a breakthrough infection is very low.</p>
</div>
<div class="text-box10">
    <h2> <i class="fa-solid fa-shield-virus"></i>PREVENTION:</h2> 
    <p>The best defense to prevent getting COVID-19 is to get vaccinated. You should also follow the same steps you would take to prevent getting other viruses, such as the common cold or the flu.</p>
     <ul>
        <li>Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds — especially before eating and preparing food, after using the bathroom, after wiping your nose, and after coming in contact with someone who has a cold.
        </li>
        <li>Wear a multilayered cloth facemask that fits snugly on your face and covers your mouth, nose and chin as recommended by the CDC.
        </li>
        <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth to prevent the spread of viruses from your hands.
        </li>
        <li>Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when sneezing and coughing or sneeze and cough into your sleeve. Throw the tissue in the trash. Wash your hands afterward. Never cough or sneeze into your hands!
        </li>
        <li>Avoid close contact (within 6 feet) with those who have coughs, colds or are sick. Stay home if you’re sick.
        </li>
        <li>Avoid close contact (within 6 feet) with those who have coughs, colds or are sick. Stay home if you’re sick.
        </li>
        <li>If you’re prone to sickness or have a weakened immune system, stay away from large crowds of people. Follow the directions of your healthcare authorities, especially during outbreaks.
        </li>
        <li>Clean frequently used surfaces (such as doorknobs and countertops) with a virus-killing disinfectant.
        </li>
        <li>Use hand sanitizers that contain at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.
        </li>
        <li>Greet people with a friendly gesture instead of shaking hands.
        </li>
        <li>Get enough sleep, eat a healthy diet, drink plenty of liquids and exercise if you are able. These steps will strengthen your immune system and help you fight off infections more easily.
        </li>
    </ul>
